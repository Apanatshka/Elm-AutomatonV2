Elm-AutomatonV2
===============
This library is a way to package up dynamic behavior. It makes it easier to
dynamically create dynamic components. It's based on the standard Elm Automaton
library, but requires GADTs, which are not supported yet...

WARNING
-------
**This library doesn't work with the current version of the Elm compiler (0.10).**
